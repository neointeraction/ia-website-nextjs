Research shows that VCs tend to invest in founders who fit familiar profiles, which can disadvantage those who don’t align with these stereotypes. Despite these challenges, many founders have navigated the landscape and successfully secured VC funding.",

Building relationships with industry leaders, mentors, and potential investors can open doors. Attend events, join startup accelerators, and tap into your local startup ecosystem to connect with influential figures.\n\n" +
      "2. Highlight Your Unique Perspective: As an underrepresented founder, your background often brings fresh insights and innovative approaches. Highlight how your personal experiences offer a unique advantage in solving specific market problems. Investors are drawn to founders who bring differentiated perspectives.\n\n" +
      "3. Develop a Compelling Business Plan: Regardless of background, a strong business plan is critical. Clearly articulate your value proposition, market opportunity, and growth strategy. Be prepared to show traction and validate your ideas with data. VCs look for founders who can demonstrate not just vision, but execution.\n\n" +
      "4. Seek Out Diverse VCs: There are an increasing number of venture capital firms dedicated to investing in diverse founders. Seek out VCs who specifically focus on underrepresented groups, as they may be more inclined to invest in founders who break the mold. Firms like Backstage Capital and Harlem Capital are great examples.",
